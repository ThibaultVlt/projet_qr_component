## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Just with my knowledge

### What I learned

The project allowed me to review HTML semantics and redo CSS in mobile first.

CSS level I used the Flexbox to place the texts

```css
div {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skills on projects with JS, I have a lot of shortcomings in JS programming
